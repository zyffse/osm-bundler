We research and develop software to reconstruct 3D geometry from a set of photos. Our software can be used in a variety of ways, in particular in the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) project.

The core tools in our system are
  * [Bundler](http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/bundler/)
  * [PMVS](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/software/pmvs/)
  * [CMVS](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/software/cmvs/)
